# Slay the Spire AI

This project is an AI agent trained to play **Slay the Spire** using **Reinforcement Learning**.  
It relies on a custom Gymnasium environment connected to a local game server and uses **Maskable PPO** from `sb3-contrib` to handle invalid actions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Install dependencies

## Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the project

To start training the AI:
```bash
python .\src\main.py
```

The script will:

- Launch the game
- Connect to the local game server
- Initialize the environment and models
- Start training using reinforcement learning
- Periodically save models and action mappings

## Stop the script

CTRL + C to stop learning
(models and actions will be saved)
